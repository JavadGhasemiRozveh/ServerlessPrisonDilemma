# Incentive-Driven Dynamic Pricing in Serverless Computing: A Game-Theoretic Approach Using Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma

Serverless computing has recently become very popular because it simplifies deploying and scaling applications. It lets users develop and run code as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) without worrying about the underlying infrastructures. It promises pay-as-you-go pricing based on usage. However, current pricing models in serverless computing are often static, charging based on execution time and memory usage. Dynamic pricing in serverless computing presents a critical challenge in balancing cost efficiency and resource utilization for both service providers and clients. In this paper, we model the serverless pricing environment as a two-sided game based on the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) and evaluate various strategic interactions. Our study consists of two experimental scenarios. In the first scenario, we analyze the game dynamics without considering long-term incentives, where each player's strategy is fixed, and payoffs depend solely on immediate gains. In this setting, defection-based strategies such as none-cooperative games tend to dominate. In the second scenario, we introduce a discount factor and present value to model future-oriented decision-making. Players with a history of cooperation receive higher future payoffs, encouraging sustained collaboration. The results indicate that some cooperative strategies significantly outperform defecting strategies over repeated interactions when future rewards are considered. These findings suggest that dynamic incentive mechanisms can be leveraged to optimize serverless pricing models, encouraging cooperative behavior among participants. Future work will explore adaptive pricing strategies that dynamically adjust based on market conditions and player behavior, further enhancing stability and efficiency in serverless computing environments.
